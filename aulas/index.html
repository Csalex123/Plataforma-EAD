            <p><strong>Overall Impression:</strong> A pale, bitter, highly attenuated and well carbonated Trappist ale,
                showing a fruity-spicy Trappist yeast character, a spicy-floral hop profile, and a soft, supportive
                grainy-sweet malt palate.</p>
            <p><strong>History:</strong> While Trappist breweries have a tradition of brewing a lower-strength beer as a
                monk’s daily ration, the bitter, pale beer this style describes is a relatively modern invention
                reflecting current tastes. Westvleteren first brewed theirs in 1999, but replaced older lower-gravity
                products.</p>

        </h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p><strong>Overall Impression:</strong> A deep reddish-copper, moderately strong, malty, complex Trappist
                ale with rich malty flavors, dark or dried fruit esters, and light alcohol blended together in a malty
                presentation that still finishes fairly dry.</p>
            <p><strong>History:</strong> Originated at monasteries in the Middle Ages, and was revived in the mid-1800s
                after the Napoleonic era.</p>

        </h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p><strong>Overall Impression:</strong> A pale, somewhat spicy, dry, strong Trappist ale with a pleasant
                rounded malt flavor and firm bitterness. Quite aromatic, with spicy, fruity, and light alcohol notes
                combining with the supportive clean malt character to produce a surprisingly drinkable beverage
                considering the high alcohol level.</p>
            <p><strong>History:</strong> Originally popularized by the Trappist monastery at Westmalle.</p>
